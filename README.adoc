== TL;DR
Container based python development. Ships with https://www.postgresql.org[postgreSQL DB] and https://github.com/wodby/adminer[adminer].
VSC setup contains some plugins and settings in link:./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json[devcontainer.json]

== Components

=== FastAPI
FastAPI is used to provide the REST API to manage Chuck Norris quotes.
The demo app was build TDD style. Coverage is currently at ~95%.
On devcontainer startup `ptw` test listener is started.


=== PostgreSQL
Current values for credentials, db name and external db port can be set in 
[source,%linenums,text,highlight=1-5]
include::./.devcontainer/.env[]

=== Adminer
Adminer is used to peek into the database.

=== Prometheus
Prometheus will collect application metrics.
Default config is shipped with this setup. 
Please refer to file://./.devcontainer/prometheus_data/prometheus.yml[prometheus.yml] for details.

=== Grafana
Is used to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.
